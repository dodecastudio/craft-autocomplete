The Auto Complete field is a plain text field that will suggest existing values from other entries saved in the same section. This can be useful for ensuring consistency between entries, without the overhead of using something more full-featured such as tags or categories.

## Requirements

- Craft CMS 3.x
- PHP 7.2.5+

## Installation

Install the plugin as follows:

1.  Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2.  Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require dodecastudio/craft-autocomplete

3.  In the Control Panel, go to Settings ‚Üí Plugins and click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button for Auto Complete.

## Overview

Once an Auto Complete field has been created and added to a section within Craft, it will appear when editing the entry. If there are other entries in that section, typing in it will suggest existing values. This plugin uses Craft's built-in autosuggest component. When installed, it'll look a bit like this:

The list will by default show up to a maximum of 200 suggestions. Results are filtered to include the most frequently occuring.

## Settings

Default settings can be overridden. Please see the `config.php` file for details.
